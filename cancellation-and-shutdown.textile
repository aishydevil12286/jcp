h2. Task cancelation

Why:
* user-requested cancelation
* time-limited
* application events
* errors
* shutdown

No way to *preemptively* stop a thread => no way to *preemptively* stop a task. There are only *cooperative* mechanisms: the task and the code requesting cancellation follow an agreed-upon protocol. One such cooperative mechanism is setting a "cancellation requested" flag.

A task that wants to be cancellable must have a *cancellation policy*:
* how other code can request cancellation
* when the task checks wether cancellation has been requested
* what actions the task takes in response to a cancellation request
