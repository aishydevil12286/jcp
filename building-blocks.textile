h3. Synchronized collections

Source of magic - *Collections.synchronizedXxx* factory methods Encapsulates the state of collection and sycnrhonizes all methods accessing state.

Problems of synchronized collections
 * Returned iterators use modification count 1) are fail-fast, throw ConcurrentModificationException 2) no sync for counts, may see stale data
 * That's the reason you May need
  ** Additional client-side locking to guard compound actions (iteration, navigation, conditional operations)
   *** Client side locking for compound actions may hurt performance
   *** Client side locking for compound actions may lead to high contention and hurt scalability
   *** Client side locking _acting_ on elements may lead to deadlock (_acting_ may lock on smth else)
  ** Copying (may require syncrhonization as well), has own performance penalty
 * Also, there are hidden iterators
